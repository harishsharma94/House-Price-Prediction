# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a Machine Learning-based House Price Prediction application.

The objective is to build a complete end-to-end Machine Learning workflow that takes historical house data, performs exploratory data analysis and preprocessing, trains and compares multiple regression models, selects the best-performing model, and deploys the final model through a Streamlit web application.

The application allows a user to enter house characteristics such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, living area, lot area, location, and other property details and receive an estimated house price.

## 🎯 Objective

The main objectives of this project are:

- Understand and explore a real-world house price dataset.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Identify relevant features for predicting house prices.
- Handle missing values and categorical variables.
- Apply appropriate feature preprocessing.
- Train multiple Machine Learning regression models.
- Compare model performance using evaluation metrics.
- Select the best-performing model.
- Create a reusable Machine Learning pipeline.
- Save the trained pipeline for future predictions.
- Build and deploy a user-friendly Streamlit application.

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses a house price dataset containing information about residential properties.

The dataset includes features such as:

- `bedrooms` – Number of bedrooms
- `bathrooms` – Number of bathrooms
- `sqft_living` – Living area in square feet
- `sqft_lot` – Lot area in square feet
- `floors` – Number of floors
- `waterfront` – Whether the property has a waterfront
- `view` – View rating
- `condition` – Property condition
- `sqft_above` – Above-ground living area
- `sqft_basement` – Basement area
- `yr_built` – Year the house was built
- `yr_renovated` – Year the house was renovated
- `street` – Street address
- `city` – City
- `statezip` – State and ZIP code
- `price` – Target variable

The target variable for this project is:

`price`

## 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis was performed before building the Machine Learning models.

The analysis included:

- Understanding the structure of the dataset.
- Checking data types.
- Identifying missing values.
- Examining numerical features.
- Examining categorical features.
- Understanding the distribution of house prices.
- Analyzing relationships between important features and house prices.
- Identifying potential outliers.
- Evaluating correlations between numerical variables.

EDA was used to help determine which features should be retained, transformed, or removed before model training.

## 🧩 Features Used

### Numerical Features

The following numerical features were used:

- `bedrooms`
- `bathrooms`
- `sqft_living`
- `sqft_lot`
- `floors`
- `waterfront`
- `view`
- `condition`
- `sqft_above`
- `sqft_basement`
- `yr_built`
- `yr_renovated`

### Categorical Features

The following categorical features were used:

- `street`
- `city`
- `statezip`

The following columns were excluded from the model:

- `date`
- `price` – target variable
- `country`

---

## ⚙️ Data Preprocessing

The dataset contains both numerical and categorical features, so different preprocessing techniques were applied.

### Numerical Features

For numerical features:

1. Missing values were handled using `SimpleImputer`.
2. Features were standardized using `StandardScaler`.

The preprocessing was implemented using a Scikit-learn `Pipeline`.

### Categorical Features

Categorical features were transformed using:

`OneHotEncoder`

with:

`handle_unknown='ignore'`

This allows the model to handle previously unseen categorical values during prediction.

### ColumnTransformer

A `ColumnTransformer` was used to apply the appropriate preprocessing to numerical and categorical features.

The overall preprocessing structure is:

```text
Numerical Features
       ↓
SimpleImputer
       ↓
StandardScaler
       ↓
Processed Numerical Features

Categorical Features
       ↓
OneHotEncoder
       ↓
Processed Categorical Features

# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thanks to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README

Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
